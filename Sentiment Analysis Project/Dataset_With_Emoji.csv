How To Check If A Cell Is Blank Using ISBLANK
Count Blank Cells Using COUNTIF
Count Blank Cells Using COUNTBLANK
Assume you have this data.

wer

Let’s just step into the example.

How To Check If A Cell Is Blank Using IF
Generic Formula

=IF(cell_address="""",TRUE,FALSE)
In the above data, there are some names that are missing. In Column C you want TRUE if it doesn’t have a name and FALSE if it does. It is easy to do this. In C2 write this formula and copy it in the cells below.

=IF(B2="""",TRUE,FALSE)
efr

The formula simply checks to see if the cell is blank or not. It uses “”  to indicate blank. Prints TRUE  if it is blank, and FALSE if not.

How To Check If A Cell Is Blank Using ISBLANK
